If I had to sum up Middlegame by Seanan McGuire with a sentence, it’s the age old adage of “Family is the one you make”. Of course this seems counter-intuitive to the plot, as the two main characters are actually related, albeit through experimentation, but that’s getting ahead of ourselves. 

Middlegame is a dark and realistic approach to the science fiction genre focusing on two alchemically connected twins, Roger and Dodger. Throughout the course of the story, we gain insight into these two people’s connected lives, and traverse the realms of connected destiny and scientific meaning. The story at times can be quite dark and bleak, however it’s a much more thoughtful approach to the ‘save the world’ storyline we typically see, especially as a standalone novel. This isn’t a negative, as the time spent between tense action is used to flesh out the individual lives of some quite extraordinary characters. Over the course of the book, I really came to admire and care for the leads, and this is helped by getting to see our characters actually age up from children to adults. Impressively, even at just over 500 pages we are able to see growth for our point of view character’s history, paying off for a satisfying conclusion that makes sense of the shared trauma and hardships.

Quite obviously, the story seems like a personal nostalgia trip through academia, especially for the brighter kids who always managed to stay ahead of the class. Love letters to American College campuses and the caffeine fuelled all nighters are littered throughout the middle section of the story, and can’t help but feel like we are privy to McGuire’s personal history in the field. It makes sense that a majority of the story is spent at UC Berkely, the school in which McGuire attended. I didn’t mind this so much, as by this point of the story we are already familiar with our characters personalities and traits.

Still, I can’t help but feel like a truly tremendous book is lying just under the surface of the one we were given. That’s not to say that the book overall is sub-par, because it isn’t. Characters are fleshed out, with motivations making sense and a wonderfully realized America that McGuire has brought to life mainly through College campuses. Maybe it’s because I’m a sucker for magic systems, especially ones as original as the one found here. I just wish more time was spent exploring the capabilities of our heroes, with a little less wold building. Focusing on a grounded take on physical and phycological manipulation, McGuire does a superb job of creating a believable fantasy while still maintaining the pesky laws of our reality. At no point did I feel left out by the scientific jargon used, which McGuire should be commended for.

Overall, I had a great time with Middlegame. I found it to be the perfect length for this story, while still allowing for more of this world to be written, and I hope it is. By the end, we are left with a well realized world and magic system that doesn’t hold our hands but still is relatable. It’s always tricky trying to balance world building and character development, but McGuire does a great job of managing the two while still creating a believable narrative that had me staying up to burn through. 

Rating: 4/5
